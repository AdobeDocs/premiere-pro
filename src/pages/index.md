### Automate complex workflows

Build panels that streamline how media is managed. Simplify the search and ingest of source media, and automate tedious and error-prone steps for final delivery.

### Integrate external hardware

Use the transmit API to send video and audio from the Program Monitor anywhere. Use the two-way communication capabilities of the control surface API to sync Premiere Pro with hardware faders, VU meters, color grading controls, and more.

#### Build across apps with <br /> standard web tools 

Premiere Pro supports the Adobe Common Extensibility Platform (CEP), which lets you build extensions using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Connect to any third-party web services you like, use standard web frameworks, and even script across Adobe CC applications.
